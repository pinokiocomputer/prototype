# What

Lets you turn any project with a `README.md` file into a documentation website.

# How

1. Create a folder with a `README.md` file, or clone a project from Github (Most github projects have `README.md` files, so they should work automatically).
2. Select the folder path when prompted.
3. You should have a documentation website running locally instantly!
